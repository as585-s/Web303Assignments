            The Great Smoky Mountains are a mountain range rising along
             the Tennessee–North Carolina border in the southeastern United States. 
             They are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains, and form part 
             of the Blue Ridge Physiographic Province. The range is sometimes
              called the Smoky Mountains and the name is commonly shortened to
               the Smokies. The Great Smokies are best known as the home of 
               the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which protects most 
               of the range. The park was established in 1934, and, with over 
               11 million visits per year, it is the most visited national park 
               in the United States.<br>

            The culture of the area is that of Southern Appalachia, and previously
            the Cherokee people. Tourism is key to the area's economy, particularly 
            in cities like Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg in Tennessee, and 
            Cherokee, North Carolina. In 2006, the Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center
            opened in Townsend, Tennessee, with the mission of preserving various aspects
            of the region's culture.[citation needed]

            The Tennessee Smokies baseball team plays in Sevierville, Tennessee and is 
            named for the mountain range.
            
            The Great Smoky Mountains are also home to The Gatlinburg SkyLift and SkyBridge.<br>

            Wilson B. Townsend, the head of Little River Lumber, began advertising Elkmont 
            as a tourist destination in 1909. Within a few years, the Wonderland Hotel and 
            the Appalachian Club had been established to cater to elite Knoxvillians seeking 
            summer mountain getaways.[85] In the early 1920s, several Appalachian Club members, 
            among them Knoxville businessman Colonel David Chapman, began seriously considering 
            a movement to establish a national park in the Great Smokies. As head of the 
            Great Smoky Mountains Park Commission, Chapman was largely responsible for raising 
            funds for land purchases and coordinating park efforts between local, state, and 
            federal entities.

            The creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park proved much more complex 
            than the creation of its predecessors, such as Yellowstone and Yosemite, which were 
            already federally owned. Along with convincing logging firms to sell lucrative lumber 
            rights, the Park Commission had to negotiate the purchase of thousands of small farms 
            and remove entire communities. The commission also had to deal with the Tennessee and 
            North Carolina legislatures, which at times were opposed to spending taxpayer money on 
            park efforts.[87] In spite of these difficulties, the Park Commission had completed most 
            major land purchases by 1932. The national park officially opened in 1934, with 
            President Franklin D. Roosevelt presiding over the opening ceremony at Newfound Gap. <br>
